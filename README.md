If you are working on Medical Images you should know about Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIFTI) formats.
For people who are working with NIFTI ".nii" images, it is hard to find a converter to work on 2 dimensional images.

With the development of Deep Learning, people started to work on huge amount of data and there are some global sources who are providing these data to scientist like ADNI. 
It is easy with some tools to work on a single image to convert it to "png" but what about you have thousans? You need to have hours, days to convert one-by-one handly.

So nii to png python file will help you to convert all .nii images to png images only showing the source folder and the output folder.


In this Python file, there are three options:

1- You can save mid slices (default)

2- You can define specific frames

3- You can save all frames (you need to create a loop inside the code)

I hope this helps you.
Good luck.
